# What I Learnt From The Project
This project gave me full understanding about how websites are created and how they operate in general. Here are a few takeaways from this project: I learnt about the structure of web pages and how to link them in order to get the perfect website using HTML and JS. Also, I learnt how to style HTML elements to create visually appealing layouts for the end-user. By using CSS selectors, properties and values properly, I was also able to utilize the concept of responsive design and media queries to be used for various screen sizes(found in Inspect Element). Finally, I was able to utilize Git fully for project collaboration and management and got to learn about the use of concepts such as branches, commits and pull requests. Not to forget the numerous bugs I spent hours trying to figure out in order to make the code run, I've gained valuable practical experience which have reinforced my understanding and are in to make me so much better at what I love to do.
